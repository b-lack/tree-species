# Tree Species
This repository is intended to support forest-specific software to get ready for internationalization.

## Structure

### Scientific Name
The [list](https://github.com/b-lack/tree-species/main/lat.json) of scientific names includes about 58000 tree species. The scientific name should be unique. Nevertheless, it is recommended to use the unique ID offered for clear and short identification beyond your own software.

### Translations
The current [locales files](https://github.com/b-lack/tree-species/main/locales) include one ore more translations of the scientific name.

The length of the list of translations varies. Only species that provide a translation are listed.

## More languages
Create an [issue](https://github.com/b-lack/tree-species/issues) for feature or language requests.

## Credits
The scientific names are taken from [GlobalTreeSearch](https://tools.bgci.org/global_tree_search.php).

Translations are automatically generated using the [Wikipedia API](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API).
